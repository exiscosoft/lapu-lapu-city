ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under CC0,
thereby relinquishing those rights in the Work to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

Definitions

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, and under any national implementation
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementation thereof.

2. Affirmer. The Affirmer is the person or entity that is making the Work
available under CC0.

3. Public Domain. A Work is in the "Public Domain" when it is no longer
restricted by Copyright and Related Rights, either because:
i. the term of Copyright and Related Rights has expired;
ii. the Copyright and Related Rights have been waived; or
iii. the Copyright and Related Rights have been forfeited.

4. License. The Affirmer hereby grants to the public a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to exercise
the Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, in any medium, whether now
known or hereafter created, for any purpose, including without limitation
commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do the same.

5. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT
OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER
OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Affirmer's Representations and Warranties. The Affirmer represents and

License and to grant the rights granted herein;

b. the Work is not restricted by Copyright and Related Rights that are
owned or controlled by third parties; and

c. the Affirmer has not granted any rights in the Work to any third party
that would restrict the rights granted herein.

7. Public Domain Dedication. The Affirmer hereby dedicates the Work to the
Public Domain and waives all of the Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
in the Work to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Affirmer makes this
dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of
the Affirmer's heirs and successors, in order that the Affirmer's heirs and
successors may not seek to enforce the Copyright and Related Rights. The
Affirmer understands that such relinquishment of rights may not be revoked
in any jurisdiction.

8. Fallback License. In the event that any of the above should be deemed
unenforceable, the Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to exercise
the Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the duration of the Copyright and Related Rights, (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising
or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
effective upon exercise of the Copyright and Related Rights in the Work by
the Affirmer or by any third party. The License shall be deemed effective
upon exercise of the Copyright and Related Rights in the Work by the
Affirmer or by any third party.

9. Affirmer's Good Faith. The Affirmer represents and warrants that the
Work is not restricted by Copyright and Related Rights that are owned or
controlled by third parties.
