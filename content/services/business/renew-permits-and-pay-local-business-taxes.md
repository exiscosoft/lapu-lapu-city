## Step-by-Step (Walk-In)

   - Get your queue number; submit last year’s permit and basic IDs for pre-check.

2. **Application & Declaration**
   - Fill out the **Business Renewal Form** and the **Sworn Declaration of Gross Sales/Receipts**.
   - Declare any **changes** (business name, nature, capitalization, number of employees, floor area, machinery, location).

3. **Regulatory Routing**
   - The evaluator will route you (if needed) to: **Barangay**, **Sanitary/Health**, **Zoning**, **Environmental**, and **BFP** for assessment/inspection.

4. **Assessment**
   - **BPLO** computes **Local Business Tax**, **Regulatory Fees**, and **Other Charges** (signage, garbage, sanitary, etc.).
   - Choose **Annual** or **Quarterly** payment.

5. **Payment**
   - Pay at the **City Treasurer’s** cashier or accredited payment options (if available).
   - Receive **Official Receipt(s)**.

6. **Releasing**
   - Claim your **Mayor’s/Business Permit**, **FSIC/Sanitary**, **Stickers/Plates**, and **Occupational permits** (if issued with the pack).
   - Post the permit and required notices **conspicuously** at your place of business.

- Prepare **scanned PDFs** of your documents (clear, legible; 1 file per requirement).
- After online assessment, proceed to **payment** (e-payment or onsite) and **permit releasing** per instructions.

> If unsure, confirm at the start of the renewal period if **online pre-filing** is open for your business type.

---

## How Your Dues Are Computed

- **Local Business Tax (LBT):** Based on **gross sales/receipts** of the prior year and your **business category** (rates and brackets per local tax ordinance).
- **Regulatory/Service Fees:** e.g., **Sanitary**, **Zoning**, **Garbage**, **Signage**, **Occupational**, and **Fire** fees/clearances.
- **Other Assessments:** May apply for **delivery vehicles**, **storage/stockrooms**, **machinery**, or **special permits**.

---

## Penalties for Late Renewal

- **Surcharge** (commonly up to **25%** of the tax due) **plus** **monthly interest** (commonly up to **2% per month**) until fully paid, subject to the city’s ordinance caps.
- Possible **closure/tagging** and **inspection findings** if you continue operations without a valid permit.

---

## Changes You Must Report

- **Change of address**, **trade/brand name**, **ownership structure**, **business activity**, **floor area**, **machinery**, or **employee count**.

## Practical Tips
