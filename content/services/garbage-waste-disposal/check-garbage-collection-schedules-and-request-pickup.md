# Check Garbage Collection Schedules and Request Pickup — Lapu-Lapu City

The City Government of Lapu-Lapu manages **regular garbage collection** through the **City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO)** and barangays. Residents and business owners are encouraged to follow the schedule and proper segregation rules.

## 1) Regular Garbage Collection

**How it works**

- Collection schedules vary **by barangay** (usually **every other day** or **3 times per week**).
- Trucks assigned to barangays cover **household waste**, **biodegradable**, and **residual/non-recyclable** garbage.
- Segregation at source is **mandatory** — separate biodegradable, recyclable, residual, and special/hazardous waste.

**Where to check schedules**

1. **Barangay Hall** — each barangay posts its official collection schedule.
2. **Barangay Facebook Pages** — most update residents when trucks are delayed or rescheduled.
3. **City Information Office (CIO)** or **CENRO** announcements for citywide advisories (e.g., during holidays or typhoon disruptions).

> Tip: Post the collection calendar on your fridge or gate to remind the household which days to take bins out.

## 2) Special Garbage Pickup (Bulk or Non-Routine Waste)

For **bulk waste** (e.g., furniture, appliances, construction debris, yard trimmings), collection is not part of the regular schedule.

**How to request**

1. Visit your **Barangay Hall** or contact the **Barangay Environment Committee**.
2. Provide details: type of waste, estimated volume, and address.
3. Barangay coordinates with **CENRO** for scheduling a **special truck pickup**.
4. Some barangays may require a **minimal fee** for bulk or special disposal.

**Items usually needing special pickup**

- Large furniture, mattresses, appliances, e-waste
- Construction/demolition debris
